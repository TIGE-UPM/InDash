Conclusion:
- Download all logs, not only related to course
- filter userid, and role in UI
- much later start including actions of teachers
- decide the visualizations
  - the average number of interactions per student (compare between student and find anomalies)
- APRIL 2022 - technical papers (a short why, why update since 2013, changes in mdl_log, focus on how to do this technically)
- MAY 2022 - teem conference (human-computer behavior), top journal, around end of this year, more on the conceptual model
- if extending existence work, half of the work must be new
- Next steps:
  - reviewing the excel file
  - think about the visualizations
  - box plots
  - thursday next meeting 
  - until 3 week of february the visualizations
  - try to have the LASI paper until the end of march


LASI22 paper 6 pages
- Intro
  - LA 
  - Log based LA
  - Moodle Log system
  - previous classification
  - problem statement (evolution of LMSs and their usage)
- Main section
  - present the tool (what happens, when, why)
- Example extraction
  - raw data 
  - visualizations


Meeting Points:
- the first milestone is only to have a valid classification system and basic analysis (no weighting of importance)
- exclude site level events (use context level as criteria) (if not excluded, students with a single class have less of these events)


Next Steps:
- Create simple custom dataTable with sort, pagination, and show/hide column features. Pass all data to component, then simply render a clickable header that triggers sort. List all available columns with checkboxes to trigger display/hide, and calculate pagination using buttons

- add grade for selected students (maybe there exists already a webservice for this)
- create a plot to show "Frequency of events per category"
- table of 20 most occured events (later data table instead of simple table)

=> remove the error_logs from the moodle plugin code
=> At the end holistic approach over all course
=> To prevent possible misclassifications, we should check in detail the interactions that occur in our test courses and mention that in the paper.
=> future work might be watching timestamps of assignment completion to deadline
