Facts:
- Four interaction categories: 
  - Student-Whom (Student/Teacher/System/Content) => SC is related to settings
  - Frequency (Transmission of content/Creating class interactions) 
        => Often: ToC: Resources, Announcments, Messages 
        => Moderatly: CCI: creating class discussions, students submit assignment + grade them
        => Rarely: Evaluating courses 
  - Participation of user (Active/Passive) => passive interactiosn seems more important than on the first glimps.
  - Login Activities
- Moodles event system (which are the logs) already categorizes into teaching, participating and others
- There are 500 different events by default


Meeting Points:
- Categorization is in progress. Takes time, but not blocking
- Adding of the category course relevant (badges, competencies) for user agent (course meta interactions) => Gamification, soft skills.
- Next steps: 
  - define features (min: connection creation, course selection, import, preview, download/export) => yes, go with min
  - technology (web service plugin in php, web app in vue/js) => has reservation regarding JS. Would prefer Python.
  - what should the user connected through the web service see? How do we regulate it? over role? => teacher for a course, admin on general site
- depending on the moodle version we might use the legacy keywords

Condiderations:
- the login/logout criteria can't be assigned to a particular class... rather take course viewed per day or other interval of time (e.g. 4h).
- how should we classify forum events? Check to whom it was responded? What about the first post of a discussion?
- how should we deal with comments in general? Student-Student/Teacher or is it regarding content?
- how do we now if a message was sent within a class?

Next Steps:
- (Angel) figure out what courses can be used for testing
- (Angel) takes care about anonymization of the user data
- (Angel) figure out the moodle version where the courses took place

+ literature review
+ a new category might be the user device (mobile/desktop)
+ update the interactions category (papers citing this one have refined them already) => 
+ assign events to categories
+ create list of non-assignable events and send to Ángel (suggest that it is reflective tasks as described in different learning frameworks)
- select technology (Vue.js for speed)
- update the export web service (we need to include more info than only the log such as role of users to distinguish teacher from student, list of users in class)


=> At the end holistic approach over all course
=> Future it might be interesting to include user agent (desktop/web/mobile)
=> To prevent possible misclassifications, we should check in detail the interactions that occur in our test courses and mention that in the paper.
