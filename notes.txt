Facts:
- Four interaction categories: 
  - Student-Whom (Student/Teacher/System/Content) => SC is related to settings
  - Frequency (Transmission of content/Creating class interactions) 
        => Often: ToC: Resources, Announcments, Messages 
        => Moderatly: CCI: creating class discussions, students submit assignment + grade them
        => Rarely: Evaluating courses 
  - Participation of user (Active/Passive) => passive interactiosn seems more important than on the first glimps.
  - Login Activities
- Moodles event system (which are the logs) already categorizes into teaching, participating and others
- There are 500 different events by default

Todos:
- Define the output application (moodle web service, visualization in another tool)

Questions:
- Which courses should the user (connected to web service) see, when connecting to the system? (All, only his courses)

Demands:
- 

Next Steps:
- (Angel) figure out what courses can be used for testing
- (Angel) takes care about anonymization of the user data
- (Angel) figure out the moodle version where the courses took place

- literature review
- a new category might be the user device (mobile/desktop)
- update the interactions category (papers citing this one have refined them already) => 
- assign events to categories


=> At the end holistic approach over all course
